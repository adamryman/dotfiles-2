dotfiles
========

Dotfiles for my laptop (in branch ``master``).
Any conflicting configuration for other machines is kept in branches rebased onto this branch.

This repo is not meant to be checked out directly in ``$HOME``.
Instead, it includes ``setup.sh`` to set up links from the actual locations to the individual files.
